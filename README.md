# Disclaimer
I feel that one should not upload the same file from repository for submission, rather implement the knowledge of SQL to solve the interesting problems and analyse data. If you didn't understand any section of the project, you can refer to my work for better explanation. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. The instructions of the project are straight-forward and well structured.
